Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

# Introcuction
    The purpose of this project is to create two clean data sets, one contains both training and test data of the mean values and standard deviations for each observation obtained from experimental research on six activities( WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) performed by a group of 30 volunteers. The other data set further averages the experimental values for each variable thus provides the average data for individual’s every activity.  

    The original data was obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository (see note below). 

# For your reference, the following documents are provided in this repo folder:
  - ‘README.md’
  - ‘run_analysis.R’: Shows the R code for the cleaning process.
  - ‘CodeBook.md’ : Instructions on variables, transformations performed to clean up the data. 

# Note:
  For Further information about the original data, please refer to the UCI Machine Learning Repository, Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems at the following link [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).
